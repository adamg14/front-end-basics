# Front End Basics
A collection of projects showcasing the fundament basic front-end development skills, using Next.js and Typescript. Taking me around 3 hours to complete. 
I have other github repositories such as: 
- [Digital Identites - A unfinished submission to a blockchain hackathon task](https://github.com/adamg14/digitial-identities)
- [Decentralised Liquidity Pool - An implementation of a liquidity pool ](https://github.com/adamg14/decentralised-liquidity-pool)
- [BlockBetting - The frontend of a blockchain startup](https://github.com/adamg14/liquidity-pool)
That showcase more advanced applications of these skills.

There are README.md files within the individual that explain the processes, installation and other information about the individual project
